# duro-monsta-cardo
This website is a inspired by the [this moment from the japanese version of Yu-gi-oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROCevLH6PGQ)

When connected, the webpage shown is of a simple button in which when pressed a card is moved down, from being hidden from the top, and a sound file is played (caution: Might be very loud).

There are two folders:

Html version: This version should run perfectly fine on your computer. Just open index.html

php version: This will send data to a server. The code is for a local host, username = root, no password and the database is called Duro.
Run Xampp and launch both the sql and apache server to get it running
